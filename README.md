### :scroll: Developer About

Technology has always been deeply interesting to me from any exposure I have recieved to it - I have decided over the past years of my life to study computing and programming both academically and personally.

#### :keyboard: I have 6 years programming experience spanning over mutliple languages and technologies such as:

- **Python**
  - Thorough experience with the language and certain *modules/packages* such as Tkinter - I have created a diverse multitude of programs for the last 6 years in Python and become quite familiar with its ecosytem.

- **JavaScript (Node.js, npm and React) and HTML/CSS**
  - Experience with developing web-based applications and CLIs (choice based games, database layer apps, etc.).

- **Java**
  - Knowledge of the syntax and data types and the ability to perform fundamental logic within the language.

- **SQL/MySQL and MongoDB**
  - Experience integrating the language/technology into Python and Node.js applications.
