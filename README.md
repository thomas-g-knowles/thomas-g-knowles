### :scroll: Developer About

Technology has always been deeply interesting to me from any exposure I recieved to it and so I have decided over past years of my life to study computing and programming both academically and personally.

##### :keyboard: I have 6 years programming experience spanning over mutliple languages and technologies such as:

- **Python**
  - Thorough experience with the language and certain *modules/packages* such as Tkinter - I have created a diverse multitude of programs for the last 6 years in Python and become quite familiar with its ecosytem.

- **JavaScript, Node.js (npm) and React**
  - Experience with developing web-based applications and CLIs (choice based games, database layer apps, etc.).

- **HTML/CSS**
  - Experience with creating/designing and styling web-based applications.

- **Java**
  - Knowledge of the syntax and data types and the ability to perform fundamental logic within the language.

- **SQL/MySQL and MongoDB**
  - Experience integrating the language/technology into Python and Node.js applications.

At this current moment, I am working on the development (code and documentation) of a varitety of desktop application GUI based projects towards my apprenticeship, utilising different technologies and languages such as Python and dwelving into C#.
